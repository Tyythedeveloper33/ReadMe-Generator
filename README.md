  ## Description  
      The Fast README Generator is a command-line application that allows users to quickly generate well-structured README files for their projects. Creating a README is an essential step in any software development project, as it provides important information about the project's purpose, installation instructions, usage, and more. With this tool, developers can save time and effort in creating READMEs from scratch and focus more on building their projects.
